Hello,
I am testing the example program PDFControlDependencyGraph.java. I would like to know the method signature of "main method".
for example, We can write program argument for "public int add(int a, int b)" in Class Name "Calculator" in test.jar.
    -appjar test.jar -sig add(II)I
But, I don't know how to write for "public static void main(String[]args)" method.
  

   I am newbie in WALA.


Best Regards,
ph
