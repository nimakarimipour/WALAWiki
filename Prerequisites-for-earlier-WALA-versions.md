#### Prerequisites for WALA 1.2.2 though 1.3.4

WALA relies on Java 5.0, but should work with Java 6.

The WALA framework relies on support from Eclipse. You are strongly encouraged to begin exploring WALA from within a fresh Eclipse 3.6 workspace. You can download Eclipse from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>. WALA is packaged as a bunch of Eclipse plug-ins, so you will need a version of Eclipse that includes the Plugin Development Tools; we recommend the "Eclipse Classic" download.

#### Prerequisites for WALA versions 1.1.1 through 1.2.1

WALA relies on Java 5.0.

The WALA framework relies on support from Eclipse. You are strongly encouraged to begin exploring WALA from within a fresh Eclipse 3.3 workspace. You can download Eclipse from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>. WALA is packaged as a bunch of Eclipse plug-ins; you will need a version of Eclipse that includes the Plugin Development Tools. (*"For Java Developers"* only won't cut it.)

#### Prerequisites for WALA version 1.0.04 through 1.1

WALA relies on Java 1.5.

The WALA framework relies on support from Eclipse. You are strongly encouraged to begin exploring WALA from within a fresh Eclipse 3.3 workspace. You can download Eclipse from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>. WALA is packaged as a bunch of Eclipse plug-ins; you will need a version of Eclipse that includes the Plugin Development Tools. (*"For Java Developers"* only won't cut it.)

In addition to the Eclipse 3.3 base, you will need the Eclipse EMF support (an Eclipse Tools project <http://www.eclipse.org/emf/>). You can install this via the Europa Eclipse update site. *WALA has been tested with EMF v2.3.0. Earlier versions of EMF will not suffice*. From inside Eclipse:

`  Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install...`
`  Search for new features to install.`
`  Choose the Europa Discovery site.`
`  Find and install EMF Runtime + End-User tools(can be found under Models and Modeling Environment)`


#### Prerequisites for WALA versions 1.0.03 and Earlier

The WALA framework relies on support from Eclipse. You are strongly encouraged to begin exploring WALA from within a fresh Eclipse 3.2 workspace. You can download Eclipse from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>.

In addition to the Eclipse 3.2 base, you will need the Eclipse EMF support (an Eclipse Tools project <http://www.eclipse.org/emf/>). You can install this via the [Callisto](http://www.eclipse.org/callisto/) Eclipse update site. *WALA has been tested with EMF v2.3. Earlier versions of EMF will not suffice*. From inside Eclipse:

`  Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install...`
