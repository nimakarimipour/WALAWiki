# About This Document

This document provides information about how to get, install, and use the WALA framework.

For now, this document lives only in this wiki, which you are viewing. At some point, we may choose to capture snapshots and preserve them for posterity ... we have not done so yet. We use the wiki format to encourage the community to contribute either bug fixes or new material to this developer guide. For now, the wiki is unprotected; we may change this should vandalism become a problem.
Feel free to contribute. [Send mail](mailto:wala-wala@lists.sourceforge.net) to [wala-wala@lists.sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=176742) if you have questions or comments on the process.

[Javadocâ„¢ HTML](http://wala.sourceforge.net/javadocs) should be the primary reference for individual classes.

You will find sections of this guide missing, incomplete or otherwise confusing. We intend this document to live as a continual work-in-progress, growing and maturing as community members edit and add to the guide. Please accept this invitation to contribute. The WALA publications department has limited bandwidth, and so your help would be greatly appreciated. Constructive criticism will be cheerfully accepted.
