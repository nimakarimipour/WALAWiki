These are tools / libraries created by other groups that build on or enhance WALA. Note that these tools are supported by the authors, *not* by the WALA maintainers. The tools are open source unless otherwise noted (but please check yourself if the license is suitable for your purposes).  Feel free to add links to other tools that we have missed.  Several of these tools were presented at the [2015 Workshop on WALA](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5750).

#### Averroes
[Averroes](https://github.com/themaplelab/averroes) is a tool that generates a placeholder library overapproximating the possible behaviour of the original library.  It is compatible with WALA's call graph construction algorithms.

#### Compare Call Graphs (JavaScript)
[Compare Call Graphs](https://github.com/MaxSchlueter/WALA-Analyses/tree/master/CompareCallGraphs) allows for comparison between the dynamic call graph obtained from a [Jalangi2](https://github.com/Samsung/jalangi2) analysis to the static call graph of a JavaScript file in WALA.

#### Hopper
[Hopper](https://github.com/cuplv/hopper) is a goal-directed static analysis tool for languages that run on the JVM.

#### HybriDroid
[HybriDroid](https://github.com/SunghoLee/HybriDroid) is an implementation of hybrid Dalvik and JavaScript analysis for WALA.

#### IDE
[IDE](https://github.com/amaurremi/IDE) is an implementation of the Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) algorithm for WALA.

#### IteRace
[IteRace](https://github.com/cos/iterace) is a static race detection tool for Java that includes knowledge of loop-parallel operations, among other features. 

#### JFlow
[JFlow](https://github.com/vazexqi/JFlow) provides interactive source-to-source transformations for flow-based paralellism.

#### Joana
[Joana](https://github.com/jgf/joana) is an information-flow control analysis framework for Java.  There is also an [example repository](https://github.com/mohrm/android-analyzer) showing how to apply Joana to Android code.

#### Keshmesh
[Keshmesh](http://keshmesh.cs.illinois.edu/) is a static analysis framework for detecting and fixing concurrency bug patterns in Java programs.

#### Optimize Java 8 Streams Refactoring

[Optimize Java 8 Streams Refactoring](https://github.com/ponder-lab/Optimize-Java-8-Streams-Refactoring) consists of automated refactoring research prototype plug-ins for Eclipse that assists developers in writing optimal stream client code in a semantics-preserving fashion.

#### Scala Libraries
[WALAFacade](https://github.com/cos/WALAFacade) is a Scala library that enables more idiomatic use of WALA from Scala code.  The CUPLV [walautil](https://github.com/cuplv/walautil) project is a collection of utility methods for WALA projects written in Scala.
